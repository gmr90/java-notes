JDK , JRE and JVM

-> Java Development Kit 
    - Java SDK
    - Contains compilers and other tools to build java applications 
    - Not necessary to run java programs 
    - Comes with runtime
 JRE: Java Runtime Environment
     - required to run java applications 
     - Runs byte code on the machine it is on 
     - Language agnostic
     - Contains stand alone JVM 
     
 JVM: Java Virtual Machine
     -  Runs on a computer any program that's compiled to byte code
     - It acts like an abstract virtual computer 
     - Has byte code loader, verifier and interpreter
     - Can convert byte code to machine specific code
  
  Java Byte code ? 
     - instruction set meant for execute by the JVM
     
     
 Five Goals 
 
 1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar
 2. It must be robust and secure
 3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable 
 4. It must be execute with high performance 
 5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic
