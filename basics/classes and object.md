Class models the real things in bussiness world

it has state and behavior 

Class - > new data type (is a template of object)
Object -> value of the type (is a instance of class)

classes are blueprints  and objects are instances
classes contains instance variable and methods

Variable shadowing: we can solve 'this' reference refers to the instance the method will be run on 
Constructor:  Helps construct the object, special method, same name as class , no return type
can use access modifiers, can have multiple constructors (constructor overloading) 

what is copy constructor: copy constructor is constructor which takes in a argument of instance 
of a same class. 

Call by value or call by reference: 
    in call always call by value
    
    - Java uses call by value
    - Any value passed as parameter is copied to method arguments
    - If the argument  is an object reference, the reference is copied 
    - The reference copy points to the same instance as the source object reference
