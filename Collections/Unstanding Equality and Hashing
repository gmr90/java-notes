Popular Collection Types"

1. List - Order, duplicates allowed
2. Set  - Set of things, not in order, no duplicates
3. Map  - Key, value pair

Collection Framework
- Not library

Benefits
- It's done for you!
- High-performance implementations
- Improves code resuability and maintainability
- Offer good "preset" data structure
- Common vocabulary for collections

Data Structures:

What collections Framework gives us
- core interfaces (Eg: List)
- Specific implementations (Eg: ArrayList)
- Abstract implementations(Eg: AbstractList)
- Concurrent implementations(Eg: ConcurrentHashMap)
- Algorithms (Eg: sort, binarySearch)
- Utilities (Eg: Arrays.compare)


Collection Interfaces
- Collection (everything in collection is extended from Collection interface except Map)
- Map


Types of Collections
- Index based retrieval collections
- Immutable collections
- Order based retrieval collections
-
Collection interface
What methods should it have ?
- Adding by index
- Fetching next element
- Finding duplicate elements
- Removing an element
- Sorting

Two ways
- Optional methods
- Iterator pattern

Collection interface
- Constructors for creating a collection
- Adding objects (without specifying where)
- Removing objects (without specifying where)
- Check if object exists
- Convert to Array
- Clearing the whole collection
