Hashing:
    the process of mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size or keys, known as hash codes or has values,
    that represent the original data in a way that can be easily and quickly looked up


  A real world analogy:
    student file (last name start with something will go it to particular row)

    - File integrity checking
    - Digital signatures
    - Caching

   Collections

   Easy way to look up!

   Finding an object in a collection

   Finding the hash!

   Equality and hash code
   When tow objects are equal according to the equals() method, they should also have the same hash code
